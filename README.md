# DDoS Attack Dataset Repository

This repository contains a dataset focusing on one specific type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The dataset is provided for research and analysis purposes.

## About the Dataset

The dataset in this repository is focused on a single type of DDoS attack. It includes information about network traffic, attack characteristics, and other relevant data points specific to this particular attack.

This dataset, gathered over the
course of one day in 2024, involved the use of 12 machines, each running 10 different dockerized scripts to carry out various DDoS attacks directed at a single victim machine.
The overall size of the dataset is around 12 GB and 15,221,056 rows, with the same properties as Benign and DDoS. The dataset was then downsized to 3,200,056 rows.

Please note that this dataset represents only one facet of DDoS attacks and may not be representative of all DDoS attack scenarios.
